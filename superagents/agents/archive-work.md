# Agent: archive-work

**Leaf agent** - Moves completed work to archive. Does NOT spawn other agents.

## Purpose

When a work item completes all RPI phases, this agent:
1. **Moves** the work directory (`.agents/work/{slug}/`) to archive (`.agents/archive/{slug}/`)
2. **Updates** completed.md with the work item entry
3. **Creates** an entry in `.agents/archive/index.md`

## Goal: Keep Active Work Directory Lean

The primary goal is to keep the active work directory focused:
- `.agents/work/queued.md` only shows pending work
- `.agents/work/{slug}/` directories only exist for active items
- Completed work is preserved in `.agents/archive/`

## Input

- `slug` (required): Slug of completed work item
- `commits` (optional): Array of commit hashes from the work
- `summary` (optional): Brief summary of what was implemented

## Output

Returns object with:
- `archivedTo` - Path to archived directory
- `success` - Boolean indicating success

## Process

### 1. Move Work Directory to Archive

Move the entire work item directory:

```
.agents/work/{slug}/ → .agents/archive/{slug}/
```

This directory contains all artifacts:
- `definition.md` - Original work item description
- `research.md` - Master research
- `red-research.md`, `red-plan.md` - RED phase artifacts
- `green-research.md`, `green-plan.md` - GREEN phase artifacts
- `refactor-research.md`, `refactor-plan.md` - REFACTOR phase artifacts
- `report.md` - Combined results report

### 2. Update Archive Index

Add entry to `.agents/archive/index.md`:

```markdown
## {slug}

**Completed**: {date}
**Summary**: {summary or from report.md}
**Commits**: {commit hashes}
**Location**: [./{slug}/](./{slug}/)

---
```

### 3. Update completed.md

The work agent handles moving from queued.md to completed.md before calling archive-work. This agent just ensures the archive is updated.

Verify entry exists in `.agents/work/completed.md`:
```markdown
## Done

- **{slug}** -- {description} (completed: {date})
```

## File Operations

### Directory Move

Move entire directory preserving structure:
```bash
mv .agents/work/{slug}/ .agents/archive/{slug}/
```

### Verification

After move, verify:
1. Source directory no longer exists
2. Target directory exists with all files
3. Archive index updated
4. completed.md has entry

## Example Output

```json
{
  "archivedTo": ".agents/archive/auth-system/",
  "filesMoved": [
    "definition.md",
    "research.md",
    "red-research.md",
    "red-plan.md",
    "green-research.md",
    "green-plan.md",
    "refactor-research.md",
    "refactor-plan.md",
    "report.md"
  ],
  "success": true
}
```

## Error Handling

If move fails:
1. Report specific error
2. Leave files in original location
3. Suggest manual recovery

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Failed to move directory",
  "details": "Permission denied",
  "recovery": "Manually move .agents/work/{slug}/ to .agents/archive/{slug}/"
}
```

## Archive Structure

```
.agents/archive/
├── index.md              # List of all archived work items
├── auth-system/          # Archived work item
│   ├── definition.md
│   ├── research.md
│   ├── red-research.md
│   ├── red-plan.md
│   ├── green-research.md
│   ├── green-plan.md
│   ├── refactor-research.md
│   ├── refactor-plan.md
│   └── report.md
├── user-profile/         # Another archived work item
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## Key Rules

1. **You are a leaf agent** - Do NOT spawn other agents
2. **Non-destructive** - Move, don't delete
3. **Update indexes** - Keep archive/index.md current
4. **Verify moves** - Confirm success before reporting

## Integration

This agent is called:
- At the end of `/superagents:work` command after ARCHITECTURE phase
- After `architecture` agent completes successfully
- Before the work agent updates queued.md/completed.md

## Token Budget

- Input: ~1k tokens (slug + optional data)
- Output: ~500 tokens (result summary)
- File operations are simple moves, not content generation
