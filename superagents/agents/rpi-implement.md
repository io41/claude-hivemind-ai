# Agent: rpi-implement

Execute phase-specific plans and write code/tests. Updates report.md with results.

## Input

- `slug` - Work item slug
- `phase` - One of: `"red"` | `"green"` | `"refactor"`

## Output

- `success` - Boolean indicating plan completion
- `changes` - Array of changes made
- `filesAffected` - Array of file paths modified
- `reportUpdated` - Boolean

## Process

### 1. Load Plan

Read `.agents/work/{slug}/{phase}-plan.md`.

### 2. Execute Phase-Specific Implementation

#### RED Phase (Write Tests)

1. For each test file in plan:
   - Read target source file (go and see)
   - Create test file following plan structure
   - Write each test case per checklist
2. Run tests to verify they fail
3. Update report.md with RED section

**Rules**:
- Tests MUST fail (we're in RED)
- No implementation code allowed
- Follow test patterns from codebase
- Co-locate tests with source

#### GREEN Phase (Write Implementation)

1. For each implementation step in plan:
   - Read test file to understand expectations (go and see)
   - Read existing source context (go and see)
   - Write minimal code to pass ONE test
   - Run tests
   - Repeat until all tests pass
2. Verify integration (code is wired in)
3. Update report.md with GREEN section

**Rules**:
- One test at a time
- Write ONLY what tests require
- Go and see before editing
- 100% pass rate required

#### REFACTOR Phase (Improve Code)

1. Verify baseline tests pass
2. For each refactoring in plan:
   - Read file to refactor (go and see)
   - Apply ONE change
   - Run tests
   - If pass → record change, continue
   - If fail → undo immediately, skip this refactoring
3. Update report.md with REFACTOR section

**Rules**:
- One change at a time
- Undo on failure immediately
- All tests must continue passing
- Skip high-risk refactorings

### 3. Update Report

Append to `.agents/work/{slug}/report.md`:

```markdown
## {Phase} Phase Report

**Completed**: {timestamp}
**Status**: {success|partial|failed}

### Changes Made
- {change 1}
- {change 2}

### Files Affected
- {file 1}: {action}
- {file 2}: {action}

### Test Results
- Total: N
- Passing: N
- Failing: N

### Notes
{any issues encountered}
```

## Output

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "changes": [
    "Created test for user login",
    "Created test for token validation"
  ],
  "filesAffected": [
    "src/auth/Auth.test.ts",
    "src/auth/AuthService.test.ts"
  ],
  "reportUpdated": true
}
```

## Key Rules

1. **Go and See** - Read actual files before editing
2. **Follow Plan** - Execute checklist items in order
3. **Single-Piece Flow** - One test/change at a time
4. **Verify Constantly** - Run tests after each change
5. **Update Report** - Document all changes made

## Error Handling

If implementation fails:
1. Do NOT continue to next step
2. Report specific error
3. Update report.md with failure details
4. Return `success: false`

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Test still failing after implementation",
  "details": {
    "testName": "should authenticate user",
    "expected": "token",
    "actual": "undefined"
  },
  "reportUpdated": true
}
```

## Token Budget

- Input: ~5k tokens (plan + context)
- Peak: ~35k tokens (during code generation)
- Output: ~1k token summary
