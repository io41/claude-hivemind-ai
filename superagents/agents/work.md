# Agent: work (DEPRECATED)

**DO NOT USE THIS AGENT**

This agent was designed to orchestrate the work queue by spawning phase agents.

**This doesn't work because subagents cannot spawn other subagents.**

## What To Do Instead

Use the `/superagents:work` command, which tells main Claude to:
1. Read `.agents/context/work.md` for workflow
2. Spawn fine-grained agents directly:
   - `work-research` - gathers context for work item
   - `rpi-research` (phase=red|green|refactor) - phase-specific research
   - `rpi-plan` (phase=red|green|refactor) - phase-specific planning
   - `rpi-implement` (phase=red|green|refactor) - phase-specific implementation
   - `verify-results` (phase=red|green|refactor) - gate enforcement
   - `git-commit` - creates conventional commits
   - `architecture` - updates docs
   - `archive-work` - archives completed work
3. Loop until queue is empty
