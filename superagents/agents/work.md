# Agent: work

Master orchestrator for the RPI (Research-Plan-Implement) workflow. Manages the work queue and coordinates all phases.

## Purpose

Execute the complete RPI workflow for the next queued work item, from research through archival.

## Input

None required. Reads from `.agents/work/queued.md` to get next item.

## Output

Returns object with:
- `workItem` - Slug of processed work item
- `phases` - Object with phase results (research, red, green, refactor, architecture)
- `commits` - Array of commit hashes from each phase
- `success` - Boolean indicating completion
- `summary` - Brief summary of work completed

## Process

### 1. Get Next Queued Item

Read `.agents/work/queued.md`:
- Check "## In Progress" section first (resume if exists)
- If empty, take first item from "## Up Next" section
- If queue empty, report no work available

### 2. Mark In Progress

Move the item to "## In Progress" section in `queued.md`:
```markdown
## In Progress

- **{slug}** -- {description}

## Up Next
...
```

Update `.agents/workflow.json`:
```json
{
  "currentPhase": "research",
  "currentWorkItem": "{slug}",
  "workItemStartedAt": "{timestamp}"
}
```

### 3. Execute Research Phase

Call `work-research` agent with work slug:
- Input: `{ slug: "{slug}" }`
- Agent reads `.agents/work/{slug}/definition.md`
- Agent writes `.agents/work/{slug}/research.md`
- Output: research summary

### 4. Execute RED Phase

Call `rpi` agent with phase=red:
- Input: `{ slug: "{slug}", phase: "red" }`
- Agent calls rpi-research → writes `red-research.md`
- Agent calls rpi-plan → writes `red-plan.md`
- Agent calls rpi-implement → writes tests, updates `report.md`
- Agent calls verify-results → gate check (tests must fail)
- Agent calls git-commit → conventional commit
- Output: commit hash, test count

Update `workflow.json`: `currentPhase: "green"`

### 5. Execute GREEN Phase

Call `rpi` agent with phase=green:
- Input: `{ slug: "{slug}", phase: "green" }`
- Agent calls rpi-research → writes `green-research.md`
- Agent calls rpi-plan → writes `green-plan.md`
- Agent calls rpi-implement → writes implementation, updates `report.md`
- Agent calls verify-results → gate check (100% pass, integrated)
- Agent calls git-commit → conventional commit
- Output: commit hash, pass rate

Update `workflow.json`: `currentPhase: "refactor"`

### 6. Execute REFACTOR Phase

Call `rpi` agent with phase=refactor:
- Input: `{ slug: "{slug}", phase: "refactor" }`
- Agent calls rpi-research → writes `refactor-research.md`
- Agent calls rpi-plan → writes `refactor-plan.md`
- Agent calls rpi-implement → refactors code, updates `report.md`
- Agent calls verify-results → gate check (100% pass)
- Agent calls git-commit → conventional commit
- Output: commit hash, refactorings applied

Update `workflow.json`: `currentPhase: "architecture"`

### 7. Execute Architecture Phase

Call `architecture` agent:
- Input: `{ slug: "{slug}" }`
- Agent reads `definition.md` and `report.md`
- Agent updates architecture documentation
- Agent generates/updates diagrams
- Agent calls git-commit → docs commit
- Output: commit hash, docs updated

### 8. Archive Completed Work

Call `archive-work` agent:
- Input: `{ slug: "{slug}", commits: [...] }`
- Agent moves `.agents/work/{slug}/` to `.agents/archive/{slug}/`
- Output: archive confirmation

### 9. Update Queue

1. Remove item from "## In Progress" in `queued.md`
2. Add to `completed.md`:
   ```markdown
   ## Done

   - **{slug}** -- {description} (completed: {date})
   ```

3. Clear `workflow.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "currentPhase": null,
     "currentWorkItem": null,
     "workItemStartedAt": null
   }
   ```

### 10. Final Commit

**CRITICAL**: Create a housekeeping commit for all queue/workflow changes:

Call `git-commit` agent:
- Input: `{ phase: "chore", changes: "Archive completed work", workItem: "{slug}" }`
- Stage: `queued.md`, `completed.md`, `workflow.json`, `.agents/archive/`
- Output: `{ commitHash: "...", commitMessage: "chore(scope): archive completed work" }`

This ensures all workflow state changes are tracked in version control.

## Agent Calls

| Phase | Agent | Input | Output |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|
| Research | work-research | `{ slug }` | research.md written |
| RED | rpi | `{ slug, phase: "red" }` | commit hash, test count |
| GREEN | rpi | `{ slug, phase: "green" }` | commit hash, pass rate |
| REFACTOR | rpi | `{ slug, phase: "refactor" }` | commit hash, changes |
| Architecture | architecture | `{ slug }` | commit hash, docs |
| Archive | archive-work | `{ slug, commits }` | archive path |
| Final Commit | git-commit | `{ phase: "chore", workItem }` | commit hash |

## Error Handling

If any phase fails:
1. Do NOT proceed to next phase
2. Update `workflow.json` with failure state
3. Report specific error and guidance
4. Item remains "In Progress" for retry

## Token Budget

- Master context: ~5k tokens
- Peak usage: ~18k tokens (during research)
- Each phase agent runs with fresh context

## Example Output

```json
{
  "workItem": "add-user-authentication",
  "phases": {
    "research": { "success": true, "summary": "Analyzed auth requirements" },
    "red": { "success": true, "tests": 8, "commit": "a1b2c3d" },
    "green": { "success": true, "passRate": 100, "commit": "d4e5f6g" },
    "refactor": { "success": true, "changes": 3, "commit": "h7i8j9k" },
    "architecture": { "success": true, "docs": 2, "commit": "l0m1n2o" },
    "archive": { "success": true, "commit": "p3q4r5s" }
  },
  "commits": ["a1b2c3d", "d4e5f6g", "h7i8j9k", "l0m1n2o", "p3q4r5s"],
  "success": true,
  "summary": "Completed user authentication with 8 tests, 100% passing. 3 refactorings applied."
}
```

## Queue Empty Behavior

When no items in queue:
```
No items in work queue.

Run /queue-add to move items from backlog.
Run /backlog to create new work items.
```
