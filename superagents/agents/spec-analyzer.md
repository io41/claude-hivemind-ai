# Agent: spec-analyzer

Supporting agent for analyzing project specifications.

## Purpose

Analyze specification files in parallel to extract requirements and create structured understanding for roadmap generation.

## Input

- `specFiles` - Array of specification file paths

## Output

Returns object with:
- `requirements` - Array of extracted requirements
- `features` - Array of identified features
- `dependencies` - Array of technical dependencies
- `constraints` - Array of constraints and limitations
- `acceptanceCriteria` - Array of acceptance criteria

## Process

### 1. Load and Parallelize

**If multiple spec files exist, process in parallel:**

```
spec/
├── auth.md        ─→ Task agent 1 ─┐
├── user-mgmt.md   ─→ Task agent 2 ─┼─→ consolidate
├── api.md         ─→ Task agent 3 ─┘
```

Launch one `haiku` Task agent per spec file with `run_in_background: true`:
- Each agent extracts requirements from its assigned file
- Use `TaskOutput` to collect all results
- Consolidate into unified requirements list

**For single file or small projects**: Process sequentially.

### 2. Per-File Analysis

Each parallel agent:
   - Read assigned markdown file
   - Parse markdown structure
   - Extract headers, lists, tables, code blocks

### 3. Identify Requirements
   - Functional requirements (what system should do)
   - Non-functional requirements (performance, security, etc.)
   - Business requirements (user needs, goals)
   - Technical requirements (technologies, integrations)

### 4. Group Into Features (Consolidation)
   - Combine related requirements into features
   - Identify feature dependencies
   - Estimate feature complexity
   - Merge duplicates from parallel analysis

### 5. Extract Constraints
   - Technical constraints (tech stack, performance)
   - Business constraints (timeline, budget)
   - Regulatory constraints (GDPR, security)

## Analysis Patterns

### Requirement Identification
```markdown
## Authentication System
Users must be able to:
- [REQ-001] Register with email and password
- [REQ-002] Login with existing credentials
- [REQ-003] Logout and invalidate sessions

### Non-Functional
- [REQ-004] Passwords must be hashed
- [REQ-005] Sessions expire after 24 hours
```

### Feature Grouping
```typescript
{
  "feature": "User Authentication",
  "requirements": ["REQ-001", "REQ-002", "REQ-003", "REQ-004", "REQ-005"],
  "complexity": "medium",
  "dependencies": ["Database", "Email Service"],
  "priority": "high"
}
```

## Example Output

```json
{
  "requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-001",
      "type": "functional",
      "category": "authentication",
      "description": "Users can register with email and password",
      "priority": "high",
      "acceptanceCriteria": [
        "Email must be valid format",
        "Password must be at least 8 characters",
        "User receives confirmation email"
      ]
    }
  ],
  "features": [
    {
      "name": "User Authentication",
      "description": "Complete authentication flow",
      "requirements": ["REQ-001", "REQ-002", "REQ-003"],
      "estimatedEffort": "3-5 days",
      "dependencies": ["User Management", "Email Service"]
    }
  ],
  "dependencies": [
    {
      "type": "external",
      "name": "SendGrid",
      "purpose": "Email notifications",
      "required": true
    }
  ],
  "constraints": [
    {
      "type": "security",
      "description": "Must comply with OWASP guidelines",
      "impact": "Implementation approach"
    }
  ],
  "acceptanceCriteria": [
    {
      "feature": "Authentication",
      "criteria": "All auth tests pass with 100% coverage"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Quality Criteria

1. **Complete Extraction** - No requirements missed
2. **Accurate Classification** - Correct categorization
3. **Clear Dependencies** - All dependencies identified
4. **Realistic Estimates** - Reasonable effort estimates
5. **Actionable Output** - Structured for roadmap generation
