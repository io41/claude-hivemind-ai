# /superagents:create-spec Command

Create or amend specifications interactively through clarifying questions, generating relevant Mermaid diagrams automatically.

## What This Command Does

1. **Detects mode** - Create new spec OR amend existing spec
2. **Gathers requirements** - Question-driven discovery through dialogue
3. **Generates spec document** - Creates/updates structured markdown specification
4. **Creates diagrams** - Generates relevant Mermaid diagrams (ER, sequence, journey, state)
5. **Converts to images** - Uses mmdc to create SVG files
6. **Updates index** - Maintains spec/index.md

## Modes

### Create Mode (New Spec)

Triggered when spec file doesn't exist or user explicitly requests new spec:

```
/superagents:create-spec user-authentication
```

### Amend Mode (Update Existing)

Triggered when spec file already exists:

```
/superagents:create-spec user-authentication
→ Detects spec/user-authentication.md exists
→ Enters amendment mode
```

**Amendment Principles:**
- Preserve existing file names (avoid breaking references)
- Preserve existing requirement IDs (REQ-XXX numbers)
- Add new requirements with next available ID
- Update existing requirements in place
- Keep diagram file names stable
- Track changes made for review

## Process

### 1. Detect Mode

Check if spec exists:

```typescript
const specPath = `spec/${slugify(featureName)}.md`
const exists = await fileExists(specPath)

if (exists) {
  // AMEND MODE: Load existing spec, ask what to change
} else {
  // CREATE MODE: Start fresh with discovery questions
}
```

### 2. Question-Driven Discovery

**CREATE MODE - Full Discovery:**

**Round 1: Core Functionality**
- What should this feature do?
- Who are the users (roles)?
- What are the main workflows?
- What problem does it solve?

**Round 2: Details**
- What data needs to be stored?
- What external services are involved?
- What are the constraints (performance, security)?
- What integrations are required?

**Round 3: Edge Cases**
- What errors can occur?
- How should failures be handled?
- What are the limits/quotas?
- What happens in offline/degraded mode?

**AMEND MODE - Targeted Questions:**

- What would you like to change or add?
- Which requirements need updating?
- Are there new edge cases to consider?
- Should any requirements be removed or marked deprecated?

### 3. Generate/Update Spec Document

**CREATE MODE:**

Create `spec/{feature-name}.md`:

```markdown
# Feature: User Authentication

## Overview
[Summary from discovery questions]

## User Stories
- As a user, I want to register so that I can access the application
- As a user, I want to login so that I can use my account
- As a user, I want to logout so that my session is ended

## Requirements

### REQ-001: User Registration
- **Priority**: High
- **Description**: Users can create an account with email and password
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Email must be valid format
  - [ ] Password must be at least 8 characters
  - [ ] User receives confirmation email

### REQ-002: User Login
- **Priority**: High
- **Description**: Users can authenticate with existing credentials
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Valid credentials return JWT token
  - [ ] Invalid credentials return 401 error
  - [ ] Failed attempts are rate-limited

### REQ-003: Session Management
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Description**: Sessions expire and can be refreshed
- **Acceptance Criteria**:
  - [ ] Sessions expire after 24 hours
  - [ ] Refresh token extends session
  - [ ] Logout invalidates session

## Data Model

![Data Model](./diagrams/auth-data-model.svg)

## User Flow

![User Flow](./diagrams/auth-user-flow.svg)

## API Design

![API Sequence](./diagrams/auth-api-sequence.svg)
```

**AMEND MODE:**

Read existing spec, apply changes:

```typescript
// Load existing spec
const existingSpec = await readFile(specPath)

// Parse structure
const { requirements, diagrams, metadata } = parseSpec(existingSpec)

// Find next requirement ID
const nextId = Math.max(...requirements.map(r => r.id)) + 1

// Apply amendments:
// - Add new requirements with nextId, nextId+1, etc.
// - Update existing requirements by ID
// - Preserve requirement IDs that aren't changed
// - Keep file name stable

// Write updated spec
await writeFile(specPath, updatedSpec)
```

**Stable References:**
- Never rename spec file (spec/user-authentication.md stays same)
- Never renumber existing REQ-XXX IDs
- New requirements get next available ID
- Diagram file names remain stable

### 4. Generate Diagrams

Based on spec content, use `diagram-generator` agent:

| Spec Content | Diagram Type | File Name (Stable) |
|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Data requirements | ER diagram | `spec/diagrams/{slug}-data-model.mmd` |
| User workflows | User journey | `spec/diagrams/{slug}-user-flow.mmd` |
| API interactions | Sequence | `spec/diagrams/{slug}-api-sequence.mmd` |
| State transitions | State | `spec/diagrams/{slug}-states.mmd` |

**On Amendment:**
- Update existing diagrams if underlying requirements changed
- Add new diagrams if new aspects introduced
- Keep file names stable (don't rename)

### 5. Convert to Images

Use `diagram-to-image` agent:

**CRITICAL: Use `npx` only - NEVER run `npm install` or `bun add` to install mermaid-cli locally.** This prevents polluting non-Node.js projects with `node_modules/` and `package.json`.

```bash
for f in spec/diagrams/{slug}-*.mmd; do
    npx @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli mmdc -i "$f" -o "${f%.mmd}.svg" -t default
done
```

### 6. Update Index

Add/update entry in `spec/index.md`:

```markdown
user-authentication.md -- User login, registration, and session management -- auth, login, security
```

## Output

### Create Mode

```

## Reference Preservation Rules

When amending specs:

1. **File Names** - Never rename spec files
   - `spec/user-auth.md` stays `spec/user-auth.md`
   - References from roadmap, todos, architecture remain valid

2. **Requirement IDs** - Never renumber
   - REQ-001 through REQ-008 keep their numbers
   - New requirements get REQ-009, REQ-010, etc.
   - If requirement removed, mark deprecated (don't delete ID)

3. **Diagram Names** - Keep stable
   - `{slug}-data-model.mmd` stays same
   - Update content, not file name

4. **Change Tracking** - Record what changed
   - List added requirements
   - List modified requirements
   - List updated diagrams

## When to Use

- At project start (create initial specs)
- When adding new features (create new spec)
- When requirements change (amend existing spec)
- When scope expands (add requirements to existing spec)
- Before major releases (review and update specs)

## Integration

- Specs feed into `/superagents:update-roadmap` for work item generation
- Specs are referenced during `/superagents:work` research phase
- Architecture docs reference spec requirements
