# Todo

Work items queue. Generated from roadmap by `/update-roadmap`.

## Completed

_No items completed yet._

---

## How to Use

1. **Add specs**: Create requirement documents in `spec/`
2. **Generate roadmap**: Run `/update-roadmap` to analyze specs and create work items
3. **Start working**: Run `/work` to begin the next item
4. **Track progress**: Items move from "Up Next" → "In Progress" → "Completed"

## Work Item Format

```markdown
- [ ] **work-item-slug** - Short description
  - Requirements: REQ-001, REQ-002
  - Dependencies: other-item-slug (if any)
  - Estimate: 1-5 tests
```
